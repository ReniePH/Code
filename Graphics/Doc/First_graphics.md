#### My first try with graphic packages
 
### Main
 * Calls the Frame class which is responsible for creating the window
 
 ### Frame
 * Creates the window with the custom values I gave it
 * creates an object from the type InstructionsForDrawing and adds it to the frame
 
 ### InstructionsForDrawing
 * contains the instructions for the drawing.
